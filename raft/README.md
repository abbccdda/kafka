Kafka Raft
=================
Kafka Raft is a sub module of Apache Kafka which features a tailored version of
[Raft Consensus Protocol](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/atc14/atc14-paper-ongaro.pdf).

*You could test the basic demo by running `bin/raft-server-start.sh`, which features a distributed counter
service that does self-increment every 0.5 seconds.*

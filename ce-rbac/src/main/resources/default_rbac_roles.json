 RBAC and Acls
 ----
 As a feature, RBAC was built to be able to work in parallel with existing (Kafka) ACLs and their
  notions of ResourceTypes and Operations.
 Other CP components like Connect, KSQL, etc previously didn't have notions of ACLs, resourceTypes,
  and operations, so for those components resourceTypes and operations were net new concepts.

 Kafka ACls are very granular; to be able to "do anything useful" you typically need to be granted
  a number of individual ACLs.

 RBAC roles can thus be thought of a "predefined" sets of ACLs that can be granted together.


 Short Overview of Kafka ACLs
  Acls were added to Kafka in KIP-140, which introduced very "filesystem-ish" flavored Operations :
    All, Read, Write, Create, Delete, Alter, Describe
  For ResourceTypes :
    Any, Topic, Group, Cluster

  KIP-133 added operations AlterConfigs and DescribeConfigs and ResourceType "Broker"

 See http://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#operations_resources_and_protocols for a table
  that lays out Kafka ResourceTypes and Operations and what they mean.

 Some Kafka ACL quirks to be aware of :
  - resourceType:Cluster operation:Create means you can create Topics on a cluster
    - It does not mean you can "create" the cluster (would be hard for the cluster to enforce that)
  - resourceType:Cluster operation:Alter means you can create/edit ACLs
  - the way you grant someone the ability to act on all resources of a given resource type is to
    use a "LITERAL" pattern with a "*" name
    - for example to consume from any topic on a Kafka cluster, grant :
      resourceType:Topic operation:Read patternType:LITERAL name:*


 RBAC Role types / what does "scopeType" mean?
 ----
 Unfortunately we have a number of overloaded/reused words that make things confusing.
  - "scopeType" and the Scope object that RBAC uses to uniquely identify a physical cluster are
    unrelated concepts.
  - "Cluster as scopeType" and "Cluster as ResourceType" are two different things.

 Roles with "scopeType":"Cluster" are referred to as "cluster roles".  Rolebinding a principal to
  a cluster role gives them the ability to perform all of the operations specified by the role on
  all resources in the cluster as defined by the role.

  Example : the ClusterAdmin role has

      "allowedOperations" : [
          {
            "resourceType" : "Cluster",
            "operations" : [... "AlterConfigs" ...]
          {
            "resourceType" : "Topic",
            "operations" : [... "AlterConfigs" ...]

  So granting Bob ClusterAdmin on a Kafka cluster means Bob can AlterConfigs of both the
   Kafka cluster and all Topics in it.


 Roles with "scopeType":"Resource" are referred to as "resource roles".   Rolebinding a principal
 to a role on specific resources (or all resources of a type with LITERAL/*) gives them the ability
 to perform all of the operations specified by the role on the matching resources

  Example : granting Bob DeveloperRead for Topic "foo" gets Bob the ability to Read and Describe
   that topic (which would be two ACLs.)

      "name" : "DeveloperRead",
      "policy" : {
        "scopeType" : "Resource",
        "allowedOperations" : [
          {
            "resourceType" : "Topic",
            "operations" : ["Read", "Describe"]  // would be two ACLs
          },


 TL;DR : scopeType is really "roleType", with value Resource meaning "ala carte" resource grants and
  Cluster meaning "bundled" resource grants.


 Taxonomy of ResourceTypes
 ----
 CP Component : Kafka
  Cluster - the Kafka cluster
  DelegationToken - legacy Kafka thing not really used
  Topic
  Group - Consumer Groups
  TransactionalId - Producer related

 CP Component : Connect
  Connector
  Secret - Connect's secret registry/store

 CP Component : SchemaRegistry
   Subject

 CP Component : Ksql
  KsqlCluster

 CP Component : C3
  ControlCenterBrokerMetrics

 CP Component : ClusterRegistry
  ClusterRegistry


 RBAC Specific ResourceTypes and Operations
 ----
 Operations : DescribeAccess, AlterAccess are about viewing and altering Rolebindings.
   They are what allow UserAdmins and ResourceOwners to do RoleBinding.

 ResourceType : SecurityMetadata
   Allows UserAdmin to view rollups of other users' rolebinding information.


 All resourceType and All operation
 ----
 These are special case grants that are used to
  - make the SystemAdmin role basically be the RBAC equivalent of Broker super.user
  - allow UserAdmin to grant roles for any/All resourceTypes
  - allow SecurityAdmin to read all Rolebindings across all resourceTypes
